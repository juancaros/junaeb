            Human capital skills for jobs in the next generation
          </h3>
          <p class="text-justify lead">
            Increasingly, highly demanded, high-skilled jobs require a diverse
            set of human capital skills beyond learned content: team-building,
            mindfulness, continous learning (see an example from
            <a
              href="https://careers.un.org/lbw/attachments/competencies_booklet_en.pdf"
              target="_blank"
              >United Nations</a
            >). Such jobs are linked to fast growing higher-ed programs with
            strict entry requirements , measured by standarized tests (like SAT
            or equivalent). Here is an example from Chile, showing the
            relationship between mean standarized college entry scores and
            enrollement size for each program across all areas of higher
            education between 2013 and 2019 (excludes programs without test
            requirements). Enrollment size is linked to higher admision
            standards, particularly for STEM, Business and Law.

            The complex mix of capacities required to be successful in atractive
            career paths, demand critical child development necessary for
            learning during the school years. Extensive evidence indicates that
            active learning at school requires a mix of socio-emotional skills
            and physical health. The
            <a
              href="https://read.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/the-heavy-burden-of-obesity_67450d67-en#page1"
              target="_blank"
              >OCDE</a
            >
            estimates suggest that normal weight children are 13% more likely to
            perform well at school, relative to their less healthy peers.
            Moreover, both physical health and socio-emotional skills are
            intimately connected.
            <a
              href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/692016?journalCode=jhc"

              >Research</a
            >
            shows that obese children tend to accumulate less socio-emotional
            skills over time.

            Again, an example from Chile can be informative. Here is a binned
            plot showing the obesity prevalence at high school level by average
            school learning performace in 2015-2017 for voucher schools (each
            observation in the data is a school). School performance is measured
            by the average standarized scores (0-100) across all disciplines
            (e.g. math, languague) and school levels (primary, middle, high).
            Overall, voucher schools with high effectiveness (i.e. higher
            average learning) also have a lower proportion of obese students.

            We face a vicious cycle: stressful environments favor weight gain
            among children, which in turn affects their socio-emotional
            development, making them less likely to adopt healthy behaviors.

          <h3 class="text-primary">Monitoring early human capital skills</h3>
          <p class="text-justify lead">
            Given the importance of early human capital accumulation from a
            life-cycle perspective, we would want to track and support
            disadvantage groups once they enter the school system. Fortunately,
            there are several ways to collect information once children are at
            school. For example, in many countries the School Meal Programs
            provide an unique opportunity to collect health and socio-economic
            information of each student.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify lead">
            Our solution is founded on exploiting the potential of such routine
            administrative data at the PK-12 ages. For example, data is
            periodically collected for all students in specific grades attending
            public and voucher schools in Chile. You can see a working example
            in the
            <b>Dashboard</b> section.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify lead">
            The toolkit is based on a simple human capital framework that
            formalize the statistical assumptions needed for a country-wide
            model that allows to predict the future path for children's human
            capital accumulation, based on the longitudinal data available from
            multiple cohorts (see the <b>Measuring Skills</b> section). The
            toolkit is based on a combination of theoretical premises as well as
            statistical foundations, using simple Python tools. More information
            about the data analysis can be found in the <b>Data</b> section and
            in our documentation available at the Github repository.

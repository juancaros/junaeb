            <h4 class="text-primary">A simple model of child development</h4>
            <p>        

            </p>            
            <p>The dynamics of child development has been increasingly a subject of study among researches in a wide range of disciplines. 
              A simple theoretical framework is based on the idea of fixed, discrete set of skills (e.g. cognition, socioemotional, prysical health, nutrition) 
              which evolve over time based on an unknown accumulation process (i.e. techonology). Similarly, we can describe the parental decisions regarging 
              child invesments as a function of child characteristics, household constrains and prices (e.g. alternative cost of time). In both cases we need to allow
              for shocks, i.e. unexpected events that can alter parental decisions but also the capacity of children to accumulate skills (e.g. natural disasters). 
              If we divide the skills between nutritional status and other capacities, we can think about this model graphically as:

            </p>
            <p>
             Ultimately, in onder to characterize, describe and predict skills,
              we are interested in two key steps. First, is important to measure different 
              skills and parental investments through simple but information-rich indexes, in order 
              to avoid dealing with too many moving pieces. Secondly, given a set of skills available, 
              we would like to describe the evolution of skills across individuals and communities, 
              in order to inform stakeholders as well as target, monitor and evaluate programs. While the 
              second step is the <b>Dashboard</b>, the first step is decribed below and in our documentation (found in
              our Github repository).

            <h4 class="text-primary">Constructing skill and investment measures</h4>
            <p>
              While measuring children's physical characteristics (e.g. weight and height) is rather straighfoward and, in some cases, quite fast, measuring other 
              aspects of development is rather cumbersome. Comprehensive, structured tests have been designed by specialists in different areas to measure congition, 
              language, socialization and other skills at different ages. Similar tools have been developed to assess parental behavior and investments. Recently, 
              strong attention has been devoted to understand the quality of information within such instruments. In many cases, only a few of the items in each scale a
              re consistently providing useful signals of an underlying measure of skill (or investment), leaving as an open question whether we require complex and 
              time-consuming tools to assess particular aspects of child development.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here, we took a much more simple approach to measurement, motivated by the availability of administrative data in Chile and the recent experiences in 
              application of latent variable models in social science research. We estimate a measurement system that allows to construct indexes of skills (or investments) 
              based in the common information across imperfect measured proxies. Intuitively, estimating this system involves stablishing some relationship with measures
               and its best linear relationship to a single variable. In the case of parental investments, the Chilean data contains frequency of parent-child interactions 
               in seven different dimensions (reading, playing, singing) in discrete bins (once per month, twice per month, etc). The result of using this method yields
                a variable that measures parental investments based on the common driver of such interactions, using the information across all households and over time. 
                As for socioemotional skills, there is a set of variables with parent-reported measures of child's behavior. I concentrate here on three measures that 
                characterize socialization, self-control and communication skills, which I refer as Externalizing Behavior, in the spirit of the Big Five Factor model. 
                While three items seem like too little information, they are in fact sufficient to identify the model (specially given repeated measures for the same 
                invididual over time). 
                <p>
               If you are more interested in the practical application of this method, you can access to the our documentation at the Github repository. In the protocol folder
               we present simple examples of data management and analysis (see methods Notebook).

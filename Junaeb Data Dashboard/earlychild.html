        <h4 class="text-primary">A simple model of child development</h4>
        <p class="text-justify lead">The dynamics of child development has been increasingly a subject of study among
          researches in a wide range
          of disciplines.
          A simple theoretical framework is based on the idea of fixed, discrete set of skills (e.g. cognition,
          socioemotional, prysical health, nutrition)
          which evolve over time based on an unknown accumulation process (i.e. techonology). Similarly, we can describe
          the parental decisions regarging
          child invesments as a function of child characteristics, household constrains and prices (e.g. alternative
          cost of time). In both cases we need to allow
          for shocks, i.e. unexpected events that can alter parental decisions but also the capacity of children to
          accumulate skills (e.g. natural disasters).
          If we divide the skills between nutritional status and other capacities, we can think about this model
          graphically as:

          </figure>

        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          Ultimately, in onder to characterize, describe and predict skills,
          we are interested in two key steps. First, is important to measure different
          skills and parental investments through simple but information-rich indexes, in order
          to avoid dealing with too many moving pieces. Secondly, given a set of skills available,
          we would like to describe the evolution of skills across individuals and communities,
          in order to inform stakeholders as well as target, monitor and evaluate programs. While the
          second step is the <b>Dashboard</b>, the first step is decribed below and in our documentation (found in
          our Github repository).
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-primary">Constructing skill and investment measures</h4>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          While measuring children's physical characteristics (e.g. weight and height) is rather straighfoward and, in
          some cases, quite fast, measuring other
          aspects of development is rather cumbersome. Comprehensive, structured tests have been designed by specialists
          in different areas to measure congition,
          language, socialization and other skills at different ages. Similar tools have been developed to assess
          parental behavior and investments. Recently,
          strong attention has been devoted to understand the quality of information within such instruments. In many
          cases, only a few of the items in each scale a
          re consistently providing useful signals of an underlying measure of skill (or investment), leaving as an open
          question whether we require complex and
          time-consuming tools to assess particular aspects of child development.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">
          Here, we took a much more simple approach to quantifying child skills, motivated by the availability of
          administrative data in Chile and the recent experiences in
          application of latent variable models in social science research. We estimate a measurement system that allows
          to construct indexes of skills (or investments)
          based in the common information across imperfect measured proxies. Intuitively, estimating this system
          involves stablishing some relationship with measures
          and its best linear relationship to a single variable. In the case of parental investments, the Chilean data
          contains frequency of parent-child interactions
          in seven different dimensions (reading, playing, singing) in discrete bins (once per month, twice per month,
          etc). The result of using this method yields
          a variable that measures parental investments based on the common driver of such interactions, using the
          information across all households and over time.
          As for socioemotional skills, there is a set of variables with parent-reported measures of child's behavior. I
          concentrate here on three measures that
          characterize socialization, self-control and communication skills, which I refer as Externalizing Behavior, in
          the spirit of the Big Five Factor model.
          While three items seem like too little information, they are in fact sufficient to identify the model
          (specially given repeated measures for the same
          invididual over time).
          <p class="text-justify lead">
            If you are more interested in the practical application of this method, you can access to the our
            documentation at the Github repository. In the protocol folder
            we present simple examples of data management and analysis (see methods Notebook).

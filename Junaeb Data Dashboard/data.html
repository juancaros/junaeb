            This project (i.e. Dashboard) relies mainly on administrative data
            from the Chilean National Board of School Aid (JUNAEB). Their large
            network of collaborators that allow for data collection at the
            invididual level for thousands of schools across the country. JUNAEB
            manages programs and services covering all educational levels from
            pre-school to college. The range of programs includes: medical and
            dental services, nutrition, stimulation and mental health,
            scholarships, transport, housing and school supplies. You can see
            more of the invaluable work they do
            <a href="https://www.junaeb.cl" target="_blank">here</a>
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify lead">
            Every year, JUNAEB requires the assistance of all schools
            participating in the SMP to collect a census of anthropometric
            measurements and household surveys. The anthropometric information
            is officially known as the Nutritional Map. Data is collected for
            all children attending public and subsidized schools in
            Pre-Kindergarten, Kindergarten, 1st Grade, 5th Grade and Grade 9
            (high school). In 2015, 742,489 children had both instruments
            applied, this is 90% of all students attending public or private
            subsidised schools. Measuring is conducted by the class professor
            (or the professor designated by the school) through direct
            measurement of children's weight and height, as well as presence of
            cavities. While there is significant variation in the methods and
            instruments used for the measurements, the distribution of data is
            consistent across sub-populations and over time.
          </p>
          <p class="text-justify lead">
            The survey contains rich information at the household level to
            characterize vulnerability along with several dimensions of child's
            health and development. The instrument presents some differences
            between each educational level. The common information is: household
            composition and interactions with index child, geographic location
            and cultural background, educational attainment and occupation of
            caregivers, physical resources for learning/development, children's
            health status and educational attainment. Also in all years there
            are questions regarding birth and breastfeeding frequency. There are
            two sections that are different between pre-school and the school
            years. The first one relates to paternal time investments (only
            available in pre-school) and the second one relates to social and
            emotional aspects the child (only available in school grades, with
            slight variation across grades).
